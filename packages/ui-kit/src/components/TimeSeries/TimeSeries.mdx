# Counter overview

The Time Series component is designed to create Propel time series metric visualizations for your front-end applications.
With two props in Static mode, **labels** and **values**, the Time Series component provides a simple way to display your data.
If you opt for the Connected mode, the component will accept the query prop, which loads the data automatically based
on [Propel specifications](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/Propel-API/schema/reference/inputs/CounterInput?variant=production).

## Basic usage

You can import the component in your React file and use it as shown in the following example:

<Source
  dark
  format="dedent"
  language="tsx"
  code={`
    import { TimeSeries } from '@propeldata/ui-kit'

    function MonthSalesChart() {
      const queryOptions = {
        accessToken: '<PROPEL_ACCESS_TOKEN>',
        metric: 'salesCount',
        timeRange: {
          relative: 'PREVIOUS_MONTH'
        },
        granularity: 'DAY',
        timestampFormat: 'MM/dd'
      }
      return <TimeSeries query={queryOptions} variant="line" />
    }

`}
/>

This will generate a time series chart as shown below:

<Canvas of={TimeSeriesStories.LineVariantStory} sourceState="none" />

As you can see, the chart comes with a set of basic styles. However, you can customize it to your liking.
Let's build a totally different time series chart now. Here's how you can access the style props:

<Source
  dark
  format="dedent"
  language="tsx"
  code={`
    function CustomChart() {
      const styles = {
        styles: {
          line: {
            tension: 0.1,
            borderColor: '#17B897',
            borderWidth: 3
          },
          point: {
            style: false
          },
          canvas: {
            width: 100,
            height: 45,
            backgroundColor: 'transparent',
            hideGridLines: true
          }
        }
      }

      return <TimeSeries styles={styles} variant="line" />
    }

`}
/>

In this example, we built a minimalistic chart where you could use on small viewports or in a mobile design maybe.
Up to you! You can adjust these and other style properties to create a unique look for your time series chart.
