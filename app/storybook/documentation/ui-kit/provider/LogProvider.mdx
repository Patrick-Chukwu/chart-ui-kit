# Log Provider

By using the Log Provider, you can provide your own messages. 
You can enable different level of logs by setting the log level type such as "error", "warn", "info" or "debug". 
You can also disable all logs by setting log level as "off". 

Log Provider will enable you to provide more accurate feedback to users in case of technical errors, warnings, info or other issues.

For example, when you set up log level as "error" to display an error log in the TimeSeries component such as "chart data cannot be loaded", you can use the following
JavaScript code:

<Canvas
  of={LogStories.LogLevelError}
  sourceState="shown"
  source={{
    transform: (code, context) => prettier(context.parameters.codeTemplate(code, context))
  }}
/>

<Controls of={LogStories.LogLevelError} />
