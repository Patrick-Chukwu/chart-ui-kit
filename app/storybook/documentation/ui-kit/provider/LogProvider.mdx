# Log Provider

You can provide your own messages by using the LogProvider setting different type of log level such as "error", "warn", "info" or "debug". 
You can also disable all kind of logs by setting log level as "off". 
This will enable you to provide more accurate feedback to users in case of technical errors, warnings, info or other issues.

For example, when you set up log level as "error" to display an error message when the Counter component's chart data cannot be loaded, you can use the following
JavaScript code:

<Canvas
  of={LogStories.LogLevelError}
  sourceState="shown"
  source={{
    transform: (code, context) => prettier(context.parameters.codeTemplate(code, context))
  }}
/>

<Controls of={LogStories.LogLevelError} />
