# Chart Configuration

We built the UI Kit on top of all the power and efficiency of Chart.js.

## Global Chart.js configuration

You can extend or override global Chart.js settings by providing a `globalChartConfigProps` function to the
`ThemeProvider` component. This function accepts the [config object](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/configuration/)
from Chart.js as an argument and should return the modified config object with your configurations applied.

Note that the settings will be applied globally to Chart.js throughout the app, affecting all chart instances, not only
those within the `ThemeProvider`.

## Chart configuration

You can customize the chart settings at the component level by utilizing the `chartConfigProps` prop. This prop accepts
a function that receives the chart's current configuration object specific to a chart type. Within this function, you
can modify and return the configuration object to tailor the chart's appearance and behavior to your needs. The changes
made through `chartConfigProps` will only affect the particular instance of the chart.
