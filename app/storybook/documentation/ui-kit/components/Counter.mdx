# Counter overview

The Counter component is designed to create Propel counter metric visualizations for your front-end applications.
With one prop in Static mode, **value**, the Counter component provides a simple, no-frills way to display your data.
If you opt for the Connected mode, the component will accept the query prop,
which loads the data automatically based on [Propel specifications](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/Propel-API/schema/reference/inputs/CounterInput?variant=production).

## Basic usage

You can import the component in your React file and use it as shown in the following example:

<Source
  dark
  format="dedent"
  language="tsx"
  code={`
    import { Counter } from '@propeldata/ui-kit'

    export const App = () => (
      <div>
        <Counter prefixValue="$" value="123000" localize />
      </div>
    )

`}
/>

This will generate a counter component as shown below:

<Story of={CounterStories.SingleValueStory} />

In this example, we have built a simple span element that can be wrapped into any custom component of your preference.
You can adjust these and other style properties to create a unique look for your Counter component.

Here's an example of how you can wrap the Counter component inside a Card to give it a unique look.

<Story of={CounterStories.ValueInCardStory} />
