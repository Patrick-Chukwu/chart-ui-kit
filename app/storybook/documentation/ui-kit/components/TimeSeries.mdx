# TimeSeries overview

The Time Series component is designed to create Propel time series metric visualizations for your front-end
applications. With two props in Static mode, `labels` and `values`, the Time Series component provides a simple way to
display your data. If you opt for the Connected mode, the component will accept the query prop, which loads the data
automatically based on
[Propel specifications](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/Propel-API/schema/reference/inputs/TimeSeriesInput?variant=production).

## Basic usage

You can import the component in your React file and use it as shown in the following example:

<Canvas
  of={TimeSeriesStories.LineVariantStory}
  sourceState="shown"
  source={{
    transform: (code, context) => prettier(context.parameters.codeTemplate(code, context))
  }}
/>

As you can see, the chart comes with a set of basic styles. However, you can customize it to your liking. Let's build a
totally different time series chart now. Here's how you can access the style props:

<Canvas
  of={TimeSeriesStories.CustomChartStory}
  sourceState="shown"
  source={{
    transform: (code, context) => prettier(context.parameters.codeTemplate(code, context))
  }}
/>

In this example, we built a minimalistic chart where you could use on small viewports or in a mobile design maybe. Up to
you! You can adjust these and other style properties to create a unique look for your time series chart.

## Props API

The following table describes the props available for the Time Series component:

<ArgTypes of={TimeSeriesStories.LineVariantStory} sort="alpha" style={{ color: 'initial' }} />

### `TimeSeriesQueryProps`
