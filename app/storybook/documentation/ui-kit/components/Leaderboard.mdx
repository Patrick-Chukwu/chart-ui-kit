# Leaderboard overview

The Leaderboard component is designed to create Propel leaderboard metric visualizations for your front-end
applications. With two props in Static mode, `headers` and `rows`, the Leaderboard component provides a simple way to
display your data. If you opt for the Connected mode, the component will accept the query prop, which loads the data
automatically based on
[Propel specifications](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/Propel-API/schema/reference/inputs/LeaderboardInput?variant=production).

## Basic usage

You can import the component in your React file and use it as shown in the following example:

<Canvas
  of={LeaderboardStories.SingleDimensionStory}
  sourceState="shown"
  source={{
    transform: (code) => prettier(LeaderboardStories.codeTemplate(code))
  }}
/>

As you can see, the chart comes with a set of basic styles. However, you can customize it to your liking. Let's build a
totally different leaderboard chart now. Here's how you can access the style props:

<Canvas
  of={LeaderboardStories.CustomStyleStory}
  sourceState="shown"
  source={{
    transform: (code) => prettier(LeaderboardStories.codeTemplate(code, 'Leaderboard'))
  }}
/>

In this example, we built a detailed table chart where you could use on small viewports or in a mobile design maybe. Up
to you! You can adjust these and other style properties to create a unique look for your leaderboard chart.

Now let's look at what all you can do with the component. The next 2 topics will cover all the props and styles you can
configure to have a nice chart experience

## Props API
