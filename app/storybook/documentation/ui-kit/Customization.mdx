# Customization

We designed the Propel UI Kit to be highly customizable and easy to incorporate into your front-end applications.
Here are some of the customization options available to you:

## Styles

You can apply your own custom styles to each component using the Styles interface. This interface includes a wide range of properties to customize your charts, such as font, canvas, tooltip, bar, line, and point.

For example, to change the color of the bars in your time series chart, you can use the following JavaScript code:

<Source
  dark
  format="dedent"
  language="tsx"
  code={`
    function MyChart() {
      // source code
      const styles = {
        bar: {
          backgroundColor: '#532AB4'
        }
      }
      return <TimeSeries styles={styles} />
    }
  `}
/>

This will change the color of the bars to a shade of purple, as shown in the following image:

## Errors

You can also provide your own custom error messages by using the error prop. This will enable you to provide more accurate feedback to your users in case of technical errors or other issues.

For example, to display a custom error message when the chart data cannot be loaded, you can use the following JavaScript code:

<Source
  dark
  format="dedent"
  language="tsx"
  code={`
    function MyChart() {
      // source code
      const title = 'Unable to connect'
      const body = 'Sorry we are not able to connect at this time due to a technical error.'
      return <TimeSeries error={{ title, body }} />
    }
  `}
/>

This will display a custom error message with a title and body text, as shown in the following image:

By customizing your Propel UI Kit components in this way, you can create unique, user-friendly data visualizations that fit seamlessly into your front-end applications.
